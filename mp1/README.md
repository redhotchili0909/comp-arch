   - **RED**
   - **YELLOW**
   - **GREEN**
   - **CYAN**
   - **BLUE**
   - **MAGENTA**
2. The circuit must be implemented in **SystemVerilog**.

### Deliverables
By **February 13, 2025**, submit the following:
- SystemVerilog source files for the circuit.
- A video demonstration of the working circuit on the **iceBlinkPico** board.

# ENGR 3410: Miniproject 2
**Due Date:** February 27, 2025
**Course:** ENGR 3410 - Computer Architecture

## Assignment Description
In this miniproject, you will use the OSS CAD suite to design a digital circuit to drive the RGB LED on your **iceBlinkPico** board so that it smoothly cycles through the colors around the HSV color wheel once per second using pulse width modulation (PWM).

### Requirements
1. The RGB LED must smoothly cycle through colors around the HSV color wheel **once per second**.
2. Use **PWM signals** to drive each color component according to the specified waveforms.
3. The circuit must be implemented in **SystemVerilog**.
4. Provide a test bench and simulation results using **Icarus Verilog**.

### Deliverables
By **February 27, 2025**, submit the following:
- PDF report explaining your circuit design and operation.
- Simulation results showing at least one complete cycle (gtkwave plot).
- All SystemVerilog source files for your circuit and test bench.
- Video demonstration of the working circuit on the **iceBlinkPico** board.
